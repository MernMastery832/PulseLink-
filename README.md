## My Contributions  
As a **Full Stack MERN Developer**, I played a crucial role in both backend and frontend development. I designed and implemented **RESTful APIs** using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, integrating **MongoDB** for storing patient records and appointments securely. I developed **JWT-based authentication** to ensure secure user sessions and implemented **Firebase notifications** for real-time updates.  

On the frontend, I built dynamic **React components** using **Tailwind CSS** and managed state efficiently with **Redux**. I optimized the **appointment booking workflow**, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience. Additionally, I collaborated with my team on **UI/UX enhancements**, **database optimizations**, and **deployment** to ensure a fully functional and scalable healthcare platform.
